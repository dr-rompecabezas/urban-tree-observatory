# Urban Tree Observatory Project

## Project Overview

The Urban Tree Observatory is a data-driven platform for monitoring and conserving urban trees in Ibagu√©, Colombia. The project centralizes tree data, enables citizen reporting, and tracks conservation efforts.

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <omdena-repository-url>
   cd urban-tree-observatory
   ```

2. Start the development environment:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. Access the different components:
   - Django backend: <http://localhost:8000/>
   - Django admin: <http://localhost:8000/admin/>
   - Angular frontend: <http://localhost:4200/>
   - PostgreSQL database: localhost:5432
   - PgAdmin: <http://localhost:5050/>

### First-Time Setup

After starting the containers for the first time, you'll need to create a superuser:

```bash
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py createsuperuser
```

You can also load initial data fixtures:

```bash
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py loaddata species
```
